# LogLine Vision Document

## Core Concept

LogLine is a **computational institutional system** that transforms human actions into verifiable trajectories, contracts into executable language, and institutions into living organisms. It creates an immutable, cryptographically signed record of all meaningful actions with their context, authorization, and impact.

## Fundamental Principles

1. **Everything is a span** - The span is the fundamental unit of storage, documentation, and execution
2. **Append-only timeline** - All information is added to a chronological timeline, never modified
3. **Cryptographic integrity** - Every span is signed and verified with Ed25519 cryptography
4. **Provenance chains** - Every action carries its full causal history
5. **Institutional memory** - The system serves as living, computable memory that can be queried and replayed

## Foundational Manifesto

> Tudo que for feito, serÃ¡ registrado.  
> Tudo que for registrado, poderÃ¡ ser explicado.  
> Tudo que for explicado, poderÃ¡ ser revisto.  
> Tudo que for revisto, poderÃ¡ ser refeito.  
> E tudo que for refeito, serÃ¡ parte de uma histÃ³ria viva, legÃ­tima e computÃ¡vel.

*Everything done will be recorded.  
Everything recorded can be explained.  
Everything explained can be reviewed.  
Everything reviewed can be redone.  
And everything redone will be part of a living, legitimate and computable history.*

## System Architecture

### 1. Microservices Architecture

LogLine is implemented as a set of independent, interconnected microservices:

- **logline-id**: Cryptographic identity system (Ed25519-based) for all entities
- **logline-timeline**: Dual persistence timeline with immutable record keeping
- **logline-engine**: Execution engine for spans and contracts (formerly "motor")
- **logline-rules**: Grammar parsing and rule execution system
- **logline-federation**: Peer-to-peer network for distributed operation
- **logline-api**: Unified API gateway for client applications
- **logline-observer**: Monitoring and analytics system
- **logline-onboarding**: Multi-factor biometric identity verification
- **logline-orchestrator**: Service orchestration and management

### 2. Dual Persistence Strategy

- **NDJSON**: Simple file-based append-only logs for offline operation
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database with powerful query capabilities
- Both formats maintain the same span structure and cryptographic integrity

### 3. Multi-Tenant Design

- Organization-level separation with proper access controls
- Tenant-specific branding and policy enforcement
- Cross-tenant operations with appropriate authorization

### 4. Deployment Architecture

- Each microservice deployed as an independent container on Railway
- WebSocket-based communication for real-time updates
- REST APIs for synchronous operations
- Shared infrastructure for database and cache services

## Data Model: The Span

The span is the fundamental unit in LogLine - a structured, signed record on the timeline:

```
{
  "id": "97967cb1-3db7-49b1-b945-ad3865b600ad",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-27T11:02:53.873596Z",
  "logline_id": "logline-id://macmini-loja",
  "author": "logline-id://macmini-loja",
  "title": "ExecuÃ§Ã£o: manifesto_logline",
  "contract_id": "manifesto_logline",
  "workflow_id": "boot",
  "flow_id": "fundacao",
  "signature": "ec7ffffe2dc6f91d4da57334cb6ecc142...",
  "status": "executed",
  "verification_status": "verified",
  "delta_s": null,
  "replay_count": 0
}
```

## LLL Language

LogLine uses a domain-specific language (.lll) for defining contracts, rules, and institutional structures. The language is designed to be both human-readable and machine-executable.

Example:
```lll
contract "manifesto_logline" {
  workflow: "boot"
  flow: "fundacao"
  created_by: "logline-id://macmini-loja"
  version: 1.0
  timestamp: "2025-09-27T14:03:00Z"
  
  "Toda aÃ§Ã£o serÃ¡ registrada"
  "Toda decisÃ£o serÃ¡ auditÃ¡vel" 
  "O esforÃ§o humano terÃ¡ valor computÃ¡vel"
  "Cada span deixarÃ¡ rastro reversÃ­vel"
  "A memÃ³ria institucional serÃ¡ viva e reexecutÃ¡vel"
}
```

## Constitutional Structure

LogLine operates under a constitutional framework:

1. **grammar_core.lll** - Universal immutable grammar for interoperability
2. **system.manifest.lll** - System-level rights and obligations
3. **Local grammar** - Domain-specific grammar with sovereignty
4. **Project contracts** - Specific implementations in projects

## Vision for the Future

LogLine aspires to become infrastructure that makes all systems alive, auditable and sustainable - similar to how HTTPS became the standard for secure communications, LogLine aims to be the standard for signed actions, verifiable trajectories, and re-executable institutions.
