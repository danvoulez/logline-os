# Multi-Tenant Timeline Integration - Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. **Added tenant-related fields to the Span struct in `motor/types.rs`**:
   - Added tenant_id, organization_id, user_id, span_type, visibility, metadata fields
   - Created SpanType and Visibility enums
   - Added builder methods for setting tenant properties

2. **Updated Timeline class in `timeline/timeline.rs`**:
   - Added tenant-specific fields to TimelineEntry
   - Added tenant filters to TimelineQuery
   - Updated append_span to handle tenant fields
   - Added tenant-aware query methods (list_spans, get_span, search_spans)
   - Added new tenant-specific methods (get_tenant_timeline, get_tenant_stats)

3. **Created new tenant-focused interface in `timeline/timeline_tenant.rs`**:
   - Implemented TenantTimeline struct for tenant-specific operations
   - Added TenantSpanOptions for configuring tenant spans
   - Implemented tenant-specific methods (create_span, list_spans, search_spans)
   - Added tenant statistics access

4. **Updated Engine in `motor/engine.rs` to support tenant context**:
   - Added tenant_id, organization_id, user_id fields to Engine
   - Added with_tenant_context method for setting tenant properties
   - Updated create_span, execute, and simulate methods to include tenant context
   - Added create_tenant_span method for explicit tenant assignment
   - Added tests for tenant context functionality

5. **Updated module exports in `timeline/mod.rs`**:
   - Added timeline and timeline_tenant module exports
   - Ensured proper public interfaces

6. **Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive documentation in MULTI_TENANT_TIMELINE.md
   - Added usage examples
   - Documented database schema, API, and SQL functions

## Database Integration

The implementation integrates with the existing SQL migration (`003_multi_tenant_timeline_integration.sql`) which provides:

- Extended timeline_spans table with tenant columns
- Row-level security for tenant data
- SQL functions for tenant operations
- Views and triggers for tenant data handling

## Next Steps

1. Complete the compilation error fixes
2. Run tests to ensure tenant-aware timeline works properly
3. Integrate with the federation system for cross-tenant operations
4. Add tenant-aware CLI commands for timeline operations

## Expected Benefits

- Data isolation between tenants
- Organization-level visibility control
- Tenant-specific analytics and reporting
- Improved multi-tenant security and access control
