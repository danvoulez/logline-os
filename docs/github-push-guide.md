# Pushing LogLine ID Changes to GitHub

## Repository Setup

Based on the conversation history, your project should be pushed to:
- Repository: `github.com/logline-computable/core`
- This will serve as the central repository for LogLine components

## Pushing Your Changes

1. **Check if remote is already configured**:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

2. **If no remote exists, add it**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin git@github.com:logline-computable/core.git
   # Or using HTTPS
   # git remote add origin https://github.com/logline-computable/core.git
   ```

3. **Push your changes**:
   ```bash
   # If this is the first push to this repository
   git push -u origin main
   
   # For subsequent pushes
   git push origin main
   ```

## Important Files to Include

Make sure these key files are committed and pushed:

1. **Multi-tenant Timeline Integration**:
   - `timeline/timeline_tenant.rs`
   - `timeline/timeline.rs` (with tenant modifications)
   - `motor/types.rs` (with tenant fields)
   - `multi-tenant-timeline.md`

2. **LogLine ID System**:
   - `modules/logline_id/` directory with all components
   - Passkey authentication implementation
   - WebAuthn integration

3. **Documentation**:
   - `README_GITHUB.md` - Main GitHub documentation
   - `timeline-integration-summary.md` - Integration details

## GitHub Actions (Optional)

If you want to set up CI/CD, add the workflow files to:
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

This will automate testing and validation of your LogLine ID implementation.

## Using SSH Keys (Optional)

If you want to use SSH for authentication with GitHub:
1. Make sure your SSH key is added to your GitHub account
2. Use the SSH URL format when adding the remote: `git@github.com:logline-computable/core.git`

## Additional Notes

- For private repositories, consider setting up GitHub Packages or Releases for dependency management
- Remember that raw URLs from private repositories will require authentication
